# Intro to WebSockets using Socket.IO

Presentation I made at a [Software Niagara](https://github.com/softwareniagara/) event called DevTricks. Goal was to tell others about WebSockets and how to get started with implementing WebSockets in [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) using [Socket.IO](http://socket.io).

To navigate, use your arrow keys or click the arrows along the bottom right. 

Sections are navigated left and right, while slides in each section are navigated up and down within their section.

### Example App

The app I built and used an example of using something built with Socket.IO is [FootBall Pong Scoreboard](https://github.com/controlz/Football-Pong-Scoreboard).
